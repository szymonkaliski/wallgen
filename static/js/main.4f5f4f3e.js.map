For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n\t   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n\t   *\n\t   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n\t   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n\t   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n\t   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n\t   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n\t   *\n\t   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n\t   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n\t   *\n\t   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n\t   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n\t   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n\t   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n\t   *\n\t   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n\t   *\n\t   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n\t   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n\t   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n\t   *\n\t   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n\t   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode.

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode.

This\n *    may only occur in the main thread and is the responsibility of\n *    ReactEventListener, which is injected and can therefore support pluggable\n *    event sources. This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .
